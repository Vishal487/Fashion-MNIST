# Basic classification: Classify images of clothing

In this notebook we train a neural network to classify the mages of clothings.

Data for this project were provided by DAC club of my institue. Data can also be found online.

# Model
Here we used keras Sequential model to train a neural network.

First, we train on less data and use remaining for validation purpose, later we train the same model on full dataset and uses this new model to make predictions on test datas.
Here, we got more than 94% accuracy on training set while near about 93% accuracy on test dataset.
